        XXxYY
     
        original: the original photo's size
     
        capXX: cap the photo with a width or height of XX (whichever is larger). Scales the other, smaller dimension proportionally
     
        widthXX: forces the width to be XX and scales the height proportionally
     
        heightYY: forces the height to be YY and scales the width proportionally
